ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mganjoo and I'm a generalist machine learning engineer based in San Francisco.

My recent experience has been in applying ML to problems like abuse, trust and safety, and
content ranking. I'm currently working on improving tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.
([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mganjoo/)).

In grad school, I've worked on research using multi-modal representations of images and
text, including a [paper on zero-shot learning](https://github.com/mganjoo/zslearning)
published at NeurIPS 2023.

My GitHub is a collection of side projects, mostly focused on web development with a focus on JS & React:
- [gchessboard](https://github.com/mganjoo/gchessboard), an accessible, interactive, and customizable
  chessboard UI [web component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
  (written in vanilla JS) that can be easily embedded into most websites.
- [Knights Tour Game](https://knights-tour-game.vercel.app/), a chess puzzle involving knight movements.
  Written in React using my gchessboard library ([code](https://github.com/mganjoo/knights-tour-game)).
- [Apple Health Exporter](https://github.com/mganjoo/apple-health-exporter) a Python module to export
  Apple Health data for analysis.
- My [wedding website](https://github.com/mganjoo/alisha-and-milind-wedding), written using
  Gatsby, React and a simple Firebase backend for RSVP management.
