ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mganjoo and I'm a generalist machine learning engineer based in San Francisco.

My recent experience has been in applying ML to problems like abuse, trust and safety, and
content ranking [[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mganjoo/)]. I have a background
in machine learning and NLP from my Masters at Stanford, where I did research on zero-shot learning
and published a paper at NeurIPS 2013 [1].

I am also teaching myself
web development on the side (I recently wrote [GChessBoard](https://github.com/mganjoo/gchessboard),
an accessible, interactive, and customizable chessboard UI component that can be easily embedded into
most websites).
