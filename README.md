ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m `@mganjoo` and I'm a generalist machine learning engineer based in San Francisco.

# ML and AI

- I am currently building [Resolve AI](https://resolve.ai/), an AI production engineer agent for helping
  on-call engineers with investigation troubleshooting and understanding systems. 
- I previously worked on the [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) assistant; specifically, on improving the
  tool use capabilities of the model and the integrations of core apps like YouTube and Maps into Gemini.
- In the past I've worked at Twitter and YouTube, applying ML to problems like abuse, trust and safety, and
  content ranking. ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mganjoo/)).
- In grad school, I've worked on research using multi-modal representations of images and
  text, including a [paper on zero-shot learning](https://github.com/mganjoo/zslearning)
  published at NeurIPS 2013.

# Side projects

  Apple Health data for analysis.
