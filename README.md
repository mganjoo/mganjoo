ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mganjoo and I'm a generalist machine learning engineer based in San Francisco.

My recent experience has been in applying ML to problems like abuse, trust and safety, and
content ranking [[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mganjoo/)]. I am also teaching myself
web development on the side (I recently wrote [gchessboard](https://github.com/mganjoo/gchessboard),
an accessible, interactive, and customizable chessboard UI component that can be easily embedded into
most websites).
 
Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mganjoo/), or through the email address on
my GitHub profile!
