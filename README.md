ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m `@mganjoo` and I'm a generalist machine learning engineer based in San Francisco.

# Professional

I currently work on improving the [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) assistant; specifically,
I've been working on improving the tool use capabilities of the model and the integrations of
core apps like YouTube and Maps into Gemini.

In the past I've worked at Twitter and YouTube, applying ML to problems like abuse, trust and safety, and
content ranking. ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mganjoo/)).

In grad school, I've worked on research using multi-modal representations of images and
text, including a [paper on zero-shot learning](https://github.com/mganjoo/zslearning)
published at NeurIPS 2023.
